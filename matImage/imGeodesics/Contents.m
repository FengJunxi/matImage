% IMGEODESICS Geodesic distances in images
% Version 1.1 04-Apr-2011 .
%
%   Some functions for computing distance function in images, and computing
%   geodesic parameters.
%
%   The base function is 'imGeodesicDistanceMap'. It propagates distances
%   from a set of markers, using a mask to constrain the propagation.
%   Chamfer distances are used as approximation of Euclidean distances.
%   The function 'imGeodesicDistanceMap3d' is its extension for 3D images.
%
%   Using Chamfer distance propagation, it is possible to compute geodesic
%   distances and geodesic path between two markers in a particle.
%
%   It is also possible to compute morphological parameters, such as the
%   geodesic diameter or the geodesic radius. For some parameters, an
%   exhaustive search is performed, making the computation time rather
%   high.
%   
%   Some functions are defined for 2D and 3D images. Some other exist in
%   two different forms. The computation of geodesic path is not defined
%   for 3D images.
